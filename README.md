# TO DO LIST

This is a simple project implementing a to do list by React (without server).

Run following commands then you can check it on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

``` shell
npm install
npm start
```

You can delete the memos or create a memo on it, refreshing the page will reset the list.

Note: If you want to create a memo with `address`, write `address:` in your input, following words will be the address.

Example: `A new memo address: New Taipei City`
